          I am an engineer with a mechanical background. But for most of my carreer I have worked work with software.
          I breifly worked as a Mechanical Designer using SolidWorks. Mostly, I've been an Application Engineer troubleshooting issue with the program,
          and training others with best practices to ensure their success with SolidWorks.
